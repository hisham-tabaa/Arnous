# üöÄ Railway Deployment Guide - FIXED VERSION

This guide addresses the `npm ci` lock file sync issue and provides a clean deployment process.

## ‚ùå Problem Identified

The error you encountered:
```
npm error `npm ci` can only install packages when your package.json and package-lock.json are in sync.
npm error Invalid: lock file's typescript@5.9.2 does not satisfy typescript@4.9.5
```

This happens when `package-lock.json` files are out of sync with `package.json` files.

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

I've updated your project with:
1. **Fixed Dockerfile** - Uses `npm install` instead of `npm ci`
2. **Updated Railway config** - Uses custom build scripts
3. **Clean deployment scripts** - Fixes lock file issues
4. **Added .dockerignore** - Optimizes build performance
5. **Fixed localhost URL issue** - Server now uses Railway environment variables

## üöÄ Quick Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Fix Lock Files (Choose One Option)

**Option A: Use the Windows Script (Recommended for Windows)**
```bash
# Run the batch file
deploy-railway.bat
```

**Option B: Manual Cleanup**
```bash
# Clean up existing files
npm run clean:win

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install
```

### Step 2: Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix lock files, Railway deployment configuration, and localhost URLs"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Deploy on Railway

1. **Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)**
2. **Click "New Project"**
3. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. **Choose your `Arnous` repository**
5. **Click "Deploy Now"**

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Once deployed, go to **Variables** tab and add:

```env
# Server Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8080

# Database (MongoDB Atlas)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/arnous_exchange?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-minimum-32-characters-long
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h

# Admin Credentials
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-admin-password

# CLIENT_URL (CRITICAL - Update this after deployment)
# This should be your actual Railway app URL
CLIENT_URL=https://your-app-name.up.railway.app
```

### Step 5: Update CLIENT_URL After Deployment

**IMPORTANT**: After your first deployment, Railway will give you a URL like:
`https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`

1. Go to Railway Variables tab
2. Update `CLIENT_URL` to match your actual Railway app URL
3. Redeploy the app

## üîß What Was Fixed

### 1. Dockerfile Changes
- Changed `npm ci --only=production` to `npm install --production`
- This avoids lock file sync issues during Docker builds

### 2. Railway Configuration
- Updated `railway.json` to use custom build scripts
- `railway:build` handles the complete build process
- `railway:start` starts the server correctly

### 3. Build Process
- Root package.json installs dependencies
- Client builds React app
- Server starts with proper dependencies

### 4. Localhost URL Issue (NEW FIX!)
- Server now uses `CLIENT_URL` environment variable
- Console logs show proper Railway URLs instead of localhost
- CORS configuration uses Railway domain
- Port now correctly uses Railway's PORT environment variable

## üåê URL Configuration Explained

**Before (Problem):**
- Server hardcoded to `localhost:8080`
- CORS only allowed `localhost:3000`
- Console logs showed localhost URLs

**After (Fixed):**
- Server uses `process.env.PORT` (Railway sets this)
- CORS allows your Railway domain
- Console logs show your actual Railway app URL
- All URLs are dynamic based on environment

## üì± Social Media Integration (Optional)

If you want social media features, add these variables:

```env
# Facebook/Instagram
FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token
FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID=your_page_id
INSTAGRAM_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id

# Telegram
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID=@your_channel

# WhatsApp
WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token
WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your_phone_id
```

## üéØ Expected Result

After deployment:
- ‚úÖ No more lock file sync errors
- ‚úÖ Clean Docker build process
- ‚úÖ Successful Railway deployment
- ‚úÖ Server shows Railway URLs instead of localhost
- ‚úÖ Your app accessible at: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`
- ‚úÖ Console logs show proper Railway domain

## üÜò If You Still Have Issues

1. **Check Railway logs** in the dashboard
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Ensure MongoDB Atlas** is accessible from Railway
4. **Check the deployment logs** for specific error messages
5. **Verify CLIENT_URL** is set to your actual Railway app URL

## üéâ Success!

Your currency exchange dashboard should now deploy successfully on Railway without the lock file issues and with proper Railway URLs!

**Next Steps:**
1. Run `deploy-railway.bat` (Windows) or `deploy-railway.sh` (Linux/Mac)
2. Commit and push changes
3. Deploy on Railway
4. Configure environment variables (especially CLIENT_URL)
5. Test your deployed application
6. Verify URLs show Railway domain instead of localhost
